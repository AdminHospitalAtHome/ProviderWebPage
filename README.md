## ðŸ’» Environment Setup
You will need to have your environment already set up for the local development of the react-native portion of the application. If you need help doing this please refer to the appropriate repository. After that, follow the below steps
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start web` - We are only using the web, so ios or android are un needed.
